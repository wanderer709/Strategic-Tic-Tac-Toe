# Strategic-Tic-Tac-Toe
More complicated, challenging, (and fun!) version of Tic-Tac-Toe for two players

- Game consists of a large (or global) 3x3 board with each slot occupied by a smaller (or local) 3x3 board.
- Players take turns placing marks on a local board. Whichever slot a player selects determines the board on the GLOBAL board where the next player's spot must be placed.
- Achieving three in a row on a loacl board grants the winner of that board a mark on the global board.
- The first player to achieve three in a row on the global board is the winner!

- Game allows players to choose any mark in lieu of the traditional 'X' and 'O'.
- Game allows players to choose which player goes first or have the game choose at random.
- Game keeps a scoreboard to show how many wins and ties each player has.
